Thanks, but I know how to generate a chart in Excel, but that is not the problem. The problem is that you sent walkthroughs for collecting data that does not match data the system requires. I sent you examples of histogram and SPC chart data. That wording you sent does not make any sense when I compare what the system needs and what the walkthrough asks for.
